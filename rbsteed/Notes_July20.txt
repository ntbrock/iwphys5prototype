Accomplished:
* Fixed reset bug
* Added time step playbar - sliding?
* Cleaned up repository

Meeting Points - Goals to Discuss:

* Trouble with object trails - tie into Euler prototypes?
* Next objective - equation translation and next prototype
* Design clarifications




Implementing in-memory historical table - object trails, graphing, unit test comparing versions


Next Feature List:

//* Ryan> Migrate inputs to jquery .change callbacks. //
//* Ryan> Each calulation should write out to the historical table varsAtStep array. //
//* Ryan> Fix keyboard controls to only apply when inputs are non-focused. //
//* Ryan> Clear console logs. //
//* Ryan> Ball needs disappear before first rendering. //
//* Ryan> Add cannon and moving platform //
//* Ryan> Clean up code - add comments and clarity.//
//* Ryan> Table css / format fix //
//* Ryan> Fix inputs.//

* Ryan> Make object trail and ball line up better.

* Ryan> Object trail must go both ways.

* Ryan> Clean up css file.

* Taylor> Whatâ€™s up with the glitching?




* Taylor> Iterate over all of the problems, and produce big tables that are every calcualtion at every timestep for every variable.

* Pair next time> Test the javascript varsAtStep against the iwp4 big tables that Taylor created.

* Pair next> Dynamically add solids onto the svg canvas based on the iwp Json.

* Pair next> Doing the inputs, then outputs, then the window size, then the time step controls. (All these things are configurable from the .iwp file).
